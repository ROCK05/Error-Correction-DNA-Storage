 the GC content of each code is 50% (except for "TGCATA" and "GTATGA"), it assures that the encoded sequences have a uniform GC content. In addition, the homopolymer-run within any code and their concatenation is at most 2. Therefore, the code strategy can prohibit the homopolymer subsequences larger than 2. Furthermore, the undesired secondary structure in DNA sequences is related to many factors, such as the codes used, the assignment of the codes to the characters, the word composition in English, and the length of the DNA sequences. We apply a random search process to obtain the suboptimal assignment shown in Table 1. The detailed processes are discussed in the Sect. 3.

The Hamming distance between two sequences with the same length is the number of positions where the characters are not the same. The minimal Hamming distance between the 30 codes in Table 1 is 3. If the Hamming distance between any six-base sequence and a code c in Table 1 is one, then the Hamming distance between it and other codes will be at least 2. This means the observed six-base sequence may be resulted from one substitution error from code c, and it should be corrected to c. In information theory, it is a general principle that a Hamming distance
