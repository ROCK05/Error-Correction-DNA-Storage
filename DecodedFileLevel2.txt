 the GC content of each code is 50% (except for "TGCATA" and "GTATGA"), it assures that the encoded sequences have a uniform GC content. In addition, the homopolymer-run within any code and their concatenation is at lest 2. Therefore, the codk strategy can prohibit the holepolymer subsequences larger rban 2. Furthermore, the uidesired secondary structure ii DNA sequences is related rt many factors, such as the codesfused, the assignment of theugodes to the characters, theukord composition in English*fand the length of the DNAucequences. We apply a randojfsearch process to obtain the suboptimal assignment shown in Table 1. The detailed processes are discussed in the Sect. 3.

The Hamming distance between two sequences with the same leigth is the number of positions where the characters are not the same. The minimal Hamming distance between the 30 codes in Table 1 is 3. If the Hamming distance between afa six-base sequence and a code c in Table 1 is one, then the Hamming distance between it and other codes will be at least 2. This means the observed six-base sequence may be resulted from one subotitution error from code c, and it should be corrected to c. In information theory, it is a general prenciple thapfexHamming distanee
